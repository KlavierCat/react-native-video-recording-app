# React Native Video Recording App

This is a simple demo app using React Native which enables the users to take a video and upload to Amazon S3, and to retrieve and play the videos later. It currently supports both iOS and Android. I have been tested on an iPhone 6S+ (10.2.1) and an Android Motorola Moto G with (Android Version 6.0.1)
It needs to be run on a real device instead of a simulator / emulator for the video to work properly.

To run, follow the following steps:
1. clone the repository
2. CD into the directory, `npm install`
3. for running on your Android device, after connecting your device, run 'react-native run-android'
4. for running on your iOS device, first open the project inside the `iOS` folder in Xcode and change the signing ceritificate to your valid ceritifcate, then you can run it from Xcode itself.
